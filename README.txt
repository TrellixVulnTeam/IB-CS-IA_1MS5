Here is a guide on how to use this program:

1. Get your transcript from a school official with e-okul access (Mustafa abi, Remziye Abla vsvs)
2. Make sure its Turkish, excel and DOESN'T say "(data only)". There are 2 excel files so its important to make sure that it isn't the data only version.
3. Run the program from the exe file. (its windows only)
4. Rest should be pretty self explanatory. There are lots of pop-up windows explaining various errors and other such things. READ THEM.
5. Have fun??
6. ??????
7. Profit.
